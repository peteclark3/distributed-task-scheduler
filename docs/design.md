# Design Document: Distributed Task Scheduler

## Overview
This distributed task scheduler allows clients to register one-time and recurring tasks. Tasks are executed within 10 seconds of their scheduled time.

## Core Requirements
- Task Types: One-time and recurring tasks.
- Scheduling: Clients can register tasks with specific execution times or cron syntax.
- Execution Time: Tasks should be executed within 10 seconds of the scheduled time.

## High-Level Components
- API Gateway: Handles client requests for task registration and management.
- Scheduler Service: Manages task scheduling and determines when tasks should be executed.
- Task Executor: Executes tasks at the scheduled time.
- Task Storage: Durable storage for tasks (e.g., Redis, PostgreSQL).
- Worker Nodes: Distributed nodes that execute tasks.
- Message Queue: Facilitates communication between components (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).
- Monitoring & Logging: Tracks task execution and system health.

## Component Interactions
- API Gateway: Receives task registration requests and forwards them to the Scheduler Service.
- Scheduler Service: Stores tasks in Task Storage and uses Message Queue to notify Worker Nodes when tasks are due.
- Task Executor: Worker Nodes listen to the Message Queue and execute tasks when notified.
- Task Storage: Stores all task details and schedules, ensuring durability.
- Message Queue: Ensures reliable communication between Scheduler Service and Worker Nodes.
- Monitoring & Logging: Logs execution details and monitors system health.

## High Availability & Durability
- Redundancy: Deploy multiple instances of API Gateway, Scheduler Service, and Worker Nodes.
- Replication: Use replicated storage for Task Storage (e.g., PostgreSQL with replication).
- Failover: Implement failover mechanisms for Message Queue and storage systems.

## Scalability
- Horizontal Scaling: Add more Worker Nodes to handle increased task load.
- Partitioning: Partition tasks across multiple Worker Nodes.
- Load Balancing: Use a load balancer for API Gateway and Worker Nodes.

## Cost-Effectiveness
- Containerization: Use Docker to containerize components for efficient resource utilization.
- Auto-scaling: Implement auto-scaling for Worker Nodes based on task load.
- Cloud Services: Leverage cost-effective cloud services for storage and messaging.

## Choke Points & Mitigation
- Scheduler Service Bottleneck: Ensure Scheduler Service is stateless and can scale horizontally.
- Message Queue Load: Use high-throughput messaging systems and partition queues.
- Database Performance: Optimize database queries and use caching for frequently accessed data.

## Scaling Up/Down
- Scaling Up: Add more Worker Nodes, API Gateway instances, and partition databases.
- Scaling Down: Reduce instances based on load, ensuring minimum redundancy for availability.
